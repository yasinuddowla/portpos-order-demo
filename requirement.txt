Project from Portonics Limited for Software Engineer (Fullstack)

**_ Please read the below instructions carefully and submit the project in the given time. This
assignment might take you 1.5 hours to complete._**
Project Overview:

Mr. Sakib has a Facebook page where he sells electronic gadgets online. He does not have his
own website. He currently sells products through Cash on Delivery (COD) method. But he is facing
some challenges in this COD system. He has decided to accept online payments through PortPos
and for that he gets access to PortPos' sandbox. Moreover, he wants to build a small, very simple
platform to track his orders.
By building the system Mr. Sakib wants to achieve the followings:

1. When Mr. Sakib receives an order on Facebook, he will go to his platform and create a new
   order.
2. Once the order is created, a PortPos invoice will be generated and the payment link can be
   copied by Mr. Sakib.
3. Mr. Sakib will be giving the payment link to his customers. If the customer makes the
   payment, he will see it on his platform.

Mr. Sakib should have an order update option so that he can switch order status from:
Pending > Paid > Fulfilled > Refund
Minimum required fields to create an order:

● Customer Name
● Customer Email
● Customer Phone
● Customer Address
● Amount
● Product Name
● Product Details

Remember Mr. Sakib has a bigger plan with his platform so he wants all the options to be available
to him in API form so he can use them in the future.
Features should include:

● Login/logout (Mandatory)
● Order List (Mandatory)
● Creating order + PortPos Invoice (Mandatory)
● Order Payment Status update through PortPos IPN(Mandatory)
● Order Return + PortPos refund (Optional)
